## Introduction

This is a command line interface for the image editor. It is a simple program that takes in a file path to an image and a command to execute on the image. The program will then execute the command on the image and save the result to a new file.

This program is written in Java and uses the inbuilt Java libraries.

## Usage

The program takes in two arguments: the path to the image file and the command to execute on the image, gnerally. In the case of brightness it takes in a third argument which is the brightness value and the same goes for contrast.

## Features

The features include:

- Brightness
- Contrast
- Horizontal Flip
- Vertical Flip
- Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
- Gray Scale
- Blur

-> More features will be added in the future.

Note that the program will not overwrite the original image file. It will save the result to a new file.
